# BearAware Website - What Changed

## ✅ Completed Successfully

### 1. Removed All Duplicate/Out-of-Place Sections

**Deleted from bottom of index.html (108 lines removed):**

```
❌ REMOVED: "AI Detection System" card (GitHub project showcase)
❌ REMOVED: "Mobile Detection App" card (GitHub project showcase)
❌ REMOVED: "How it works" technical details
❌ REMOVED: "Technology Stack" list
❌ REMOVED: "Run in 3 steps" command-line instructions
❌ REMOVED: "Handy options" CLI parameters
❌ REMOVED: "The Urgent Need for Bear Protection" (duplicate statistics section)
```

**Why removed:**
- These were GitHub README sections, not appropriate for a competition website
- Technical CLI commands belong in developer docs, not judge presentations
- Statistics were already covered in "Criza Urșilor Carpatini" section
- GitHub links are already in the CTA section
